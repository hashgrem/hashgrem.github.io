*You just found a website with a new concept: do not store anything in a database, and do not let user to chose their password.* 

*All stored data are volatile, and will be cleaned everyday. To register an account, you just have to put a username, and the website will generate you a password according to your username.*
*Once an account is create, the username is locked for you, so you will be the only one to access your data.*

*Find how the website generate passwords, and take over admin account to view all his secrets*
    
*Bruteforce is useless!*
