I firsty performed a nmap scan to understand the target.
### Recon & enum

```
nmap -sV -T4 7c21111516t.hackday.fr
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-17 19:36 CET

So, we have a web server and something on port 5901. I didn't know this port, so I did some research and found this:

![0](/images/step0.1.png)

So probably a VNC server on this port.

By reaching the website, we arrived on an index.php page, containing a login form.

![0](/images/step0.png)

I continued in my recon phase and looked for well-known files and successfully get a /robots.txt

![0](/images/step0.5.png)

And we get the following content:

![0](/images/step0.7.png)

Here, my first idea was to try to connect to the login form with a combo of user/password from this suggestion list. So, wrote a python script, but i didn't get connected.

### Exploitation
In this case, my next idea was to try an SQL injection

![0](/images/step1.png)

And it worked !


![0](/images/step1.5.png)

Now, we arrived on a page with a slider of 30 images. We don't find anything interesting on the images, so I decided to check the source code and found an interesting comment:

![0](/images/step2.png)

### Steganography

Here, we understand that there is probably hidden data in images. My first intention was to check the highest size image but i didn't get any usefull information. So, I understood I'll have to check all images. In order to not download and try all images one by one, i used the following oneliner to win time:

`for i in {1..30}; do wget https://7c21111516t.hackday.fr/images/slides/$(printf "%03d" "$i").jpg; done`

![0](/images/step2.1.png)

Then, I created a wordlist file containing data found in /passwordSuggestionList.txt

![0](/images/step2.2.png)

Once all images are dowloaded, i used the following oneliner in order to perform a *steghide extract* by trying all passwords for each image.

`for file in *.jpg; do for pass in $(cat wordlist.txt); do steghide extract -p "$pass" -sf "$file"; echo "$pass:$file"; done; done`

![0](/images/2.4.png)

We found a hidden file in `017.jpg` with `estrella` as passphrase.

![0](/images/step3.png)

Let's do some GEOINT with GPS coordinates.

### GEOINT

By pasting coordinates in Google Maps, we arrived on a site in New-Zealand with the longest place name in the world:

`Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu`

![0](/images/step3.5.png)

By extracting first 8 characters, we get `taumataw`

At this moment, i tried a lot of things with this password and I didn't get anything usefull. But my team mate finally found the flag by trying to connect to the VNC server with `vncviewer`.

### Flag

![0](/images/step4.png)

And we got the flag !
