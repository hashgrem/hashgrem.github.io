## Endpoint

By reaching the endpoint, we arrive on this main page:

![2](/images/pointer_overflow/the%20way/main_page.png)

I first thought that I had entered the wrong URL, but looking at the network inspector, we noticed that it is a fake error page. Indeed, the HTTP code is 200.

## Source Code

Since there is no user input, let's look at the source code.

![2](/images/pointer_overflow/the%20way/source_code.png)

We notice the following Javascript code :

```javascript
let part_1 = [112, 111, 99, 116].map(x => String.fromCharCode(x)).join('');
let part_2 = atob("Znt1d3NwXw==");
let part_3 = "document.cookie";
let part_4 = "XzdydTdoXw==";
let part_5_hex = [0x31, 0x35, 0x5f, 0x30, 0x75, 0x37, 0x5f, 0x37, 0x68, 0x33, 0x72, 0x33, 0x7d];

console.log("The Tooth is Over There.");
document.cookie = "\u0037\u0068\u0033";
```

We understand here that we will have to build the flag with the different parts.

## Flag

Pretty simple. Here is my JS script:

```javascript
let part_1 = [112, 111, 99, 116].map(x => String.fromCharCode(x)).join('');
let part_2 = atob("Znt1d3NwXw==");
let part_3 = "\u0037\u0068\u0033";
let part_4 =  atob("XzdydTdoXw==");
let part_5 = [0x31, 0x35, 0x5f, 0x30, 0x75, 0x37, 0x5f, 0x37, 0x68, 0x33, 0x72, 0x33, 0x7d].map(e => String.fromCharCode(e)).join('');

console.log('Flag: '+part_1+part_2+part_3+part_4+part_5)
```
