*DEADFACE extracted a sensitive photo from Lytton Labs. As far as we can tell, itâ€™s just a normal photo of a neighborhood at night, but the man who took the photo insists he saw something else. Here is the manâ€™s original tweet. He later added the following image below.*

*Submit the flag as* `flag{flag_text_here}`

## Given File

We are given the following `.png` file:

![2](/images/deadface/steg/didyouseeit.png)

## Aperi'Solve

After uploading we quickly notice new data appearing after color manipulation:
