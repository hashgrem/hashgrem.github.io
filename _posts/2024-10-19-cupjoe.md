## Given File

We are given the following picture:

## Reverse Image Lookup

I first used Google Lens to find similar images.

We immediately find an image that seems to correspond to ours. We can go to the proposed site to obtain more information. [https://monaghansrvc.com/post/top-28-avocado-toast-in-fresno.p7781](https://monaghansrvc.com/post/top-28-avocado-toast-in-fresno.p7781)

Arriving on the site, we find a ranking of the best avocado toast in the city of Fresno. However, we cannot find any article showing our previous image.

Returning to our initial image, we notice a street or avenue name.

It looks like `Van Ness`.

Back on our site, we notice in the top 12, a coffee shop called as our street name.

By going to Google reviews, we find our coffee shop, with the precise address confirming the city of Fresno, and showing the zip code.
