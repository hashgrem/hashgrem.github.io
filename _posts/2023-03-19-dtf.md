*A young space archaeologist with a passion for 21áµ‰ century culture was wandering through ruins in the constellation Leo. During his break, he relaxes by listening to a rap video from that era. To his amazement, he notices that the location of the video's filming bears a strong resemblance to the one he is in. He would like to know what this place was used for, but unfortunately he doesn't have the skills. He gives you the mission to find the main activity carried out in the place where this magnificent rap video was shot: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q7esbZ0l0Y&t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q7esbZ0l0Y&t=1s </a>*

*The flag is to be constructed in the form `HACKDAY{...}` with "..." your answer in lower case.*

*example : you found "Sport" becomes HACKDAY{sport}*

Looking at the clip for the first time, it is not easy to find the sport because of the different special effects and light effects.
So, in order to get more details about the place, I simply make de following query:

And then, my attention fell on this video:

20 first seconds gives us a really good vision of the scene where the clip took place:

Just a second later, we have a satellite view, captured by a drone.

With those informations I hesitated between airsoft and paintball. But by looking closely at the backstage video, I didn't see any stains or pieces of paint. So I deducted it wasn't paintball. In this case, I tried for airsoft and it worked !
